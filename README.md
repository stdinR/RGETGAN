# RGETGAN
RGETGAN, titled 'Reference-based Gradient-assisted Enhanced Texture Generative Adversial Network for Remote Sensing Image Super-resolution', will be open-source soon after paper reviewed. 
Before that, a novel dataset, namely KaggleSRD, is already available for public reference. 


## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.6+ on Ubuntu 22.04
* CUDA > 11.1 and gcc > 7 (for DCN_v3 installation) and supported pyTorch >= 1.0 
* Python packages: `pip install lmdb numpy pyyaml opencv-python`
* DCN_v3 installation: (more about DCN_v3 please refer to [InternImage](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternImage)
* `cd ./RGETGAN/codes/ops_dcn_v3`
* `sh make.sh`
